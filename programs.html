    <h1> Our Programs </h1>
    <p>Our core programs are rooted in three culturally rich neighborhoods: Bedford-Stuyvesant, Harlem, and Hunts Point. While we work citywide, anchoring our work in these neighborhoods allows us to get to know and support our neighbors over the long term as we make the strong, resilient communities we want to live in together.</p>

      <h2>Artist Development</h2>

      <p>Our flagship program, Create Change, is designed to connect communities and artists in meaningful ways. We envision building a corps of artists inspired and equipped to work alongside everyday folks in creative endeavors right where they live.</p>

      <p>The program recognizes that artists and the roles they play within their own communities ultimately improve the holistic quality of life in New York City’s diverse communities, particularly those of color and modest income. Over the long-term, we intend to foster and support artist-leaders who are empowered by, committed to, and fully conversant in community-attuned art practices.</p>

    <h2>Arts Education</h2>

    <p>Our arts education work takes place through hands-on, community-centered art workshops and public programs at local laundromats and other community spaces. We aim to make art education more readily available to all our community members—regardless of income, age, or background. We believe it is a basic human right to use our imaginations in the service of a better life.</p>
