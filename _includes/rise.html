    <h3>Risë Wilson</h3>

    <h4>Robert Rauschenberg Foundation</h4>

    <p>Risë Wilson joined the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation (RRF) as their inaugural Director of Philanthropy in August 2013. As a member of the foundation’s senior leadership team, Risë is leading the organization through a new phase of charitable giving– one that builds on the legacy of its founder while remaining relevant to contemporary concerns. To that end, the foundation supports initiatives at the intersection of arts and political issues, particularly those that embody the fearlessness, innovation, and multidisciplinary approach that Rauschenberg exemplified in both his art and philanthropic endeavors. RRF is particularly interested in the role of creative problem solving in achieving social change. Before entering the field of cultural philanthropy, she founded The Laundromat Project, an award-winning organization that mounts public art projects and other art programs in local laundromats as a way of amplifying the creative power available in neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy, Harlem, and the South Bronx. Ms. Wilson’s sixteen- year tenure in arts and culture includes roles at the Ford Foundation, Parsons: the New School for Design, MoMA, and the International Center for Photography. She holds a BA from Columbia University where she was a Kluge Scholar, and an MA from NYU, where she was a Maccracken Fellow.</p>
